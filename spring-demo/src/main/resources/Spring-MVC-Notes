Spring MVC

MVC(Modal View Controller) is a Design Pattern baked in to Spring Framework to allow us to create Web Applications.
User = (Browser) uses Controller via request. Request has been made when you type in a URL in the address bar of your
browser. URL is sent as a request, and it is intercepted by your web application. Spring sees the URL and checks
if it has mapped to a Controller.(To be able to create Controller we use @Controller annotation, in class level, 
to mark as an actual component in Spring Framework's Object Modal. @Controller extends from @Component)

What Controller does? 
Intercepts the web requests, and takes the URL and maps it to a potentially method inside of your Controller.
That's actually done by @RequestMapping annotation. From the method, you can start building and manipulating the MODAL.

What Modal does?
You can build the modal by @ModalMap annotation. It's just like a HashMap. Modal is what you used to store,
all of the pertinent information, the data the objects, and that is going to be sent to and display inside of view.
View is actual HTML page or JSP file.
